Add Halo Skills to [Blue Archive Halos](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blue-archive-halos) with Datapack.

I found [this](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blue-archive-halos) wonderfull mod created by [spicywolfoffical](https://www.curseforge.com/members/spicywolfoffical/projects).
It's really interesting to be able to wear **Blue Archive** Halo in Minecraft and use it as a typical **Netherite Helmet**.

### But.
what if it could do more than that?

and so, I created this Datapack to add Skills to the Halo.

## How use this Datapack

first, install [Blue Archive Halos](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blue-archive-halos) Mod

dowload this repo as a zip file (**make sure to choose the correct branch with version matching your Minecraft version**) and rename it to `betterhalo` (keep the extension as `.zip`)
> Renaming is important as the game expects the folder name to match with datapack `namespace`

then open the world folder (folder where your single player world is saved)
usually located in `.minecraft/saves/`

inside the world folder you wish to install, find folder called `datapacks` (usually located in `.minecraft/saves/YOUR WORLD NAME/datapacks/`)
paste the downloaded `zip` file here.

It should work fine even without unzipping but, you can unzip it if you want.

the location of the installed datapack should look similar to this

```
.minecraft/saves/YOUR WORLD NAME/datapacks/betterhalo
```

> you can use this datapack in a server ONLY IF you are the one hosting it.
> Datapacks can be installed in the server the same way it's done on a single player world, by pasting datapack in the world's `datapack` folder.

## How to get the Halos
this datapack doesn't modify how Halos are obtain.
everything remain as is.

> - Find an Armorer Villager, then trade by using Netherite Helmet.
> - No need to use emerald!
> - You can also use a halo to get a different one; the Netherite Ingots are rare.

## About the Skills
Nope, not gona tell you what each skill does.
> hint for every skills is in [skills.md](./skills.md)

Finding what each Halo does is part of the fun.

## Important Notes

- Not all Halo have have skill(s) implemented yet (I'm still working on it.)
the list of Halo with skill(s) are `alice`, `hoshino`, `miku`, `shiroko` and `yuuka`
